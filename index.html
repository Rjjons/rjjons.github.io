      I am Jonah R. Etubi, from the middle-belt of Nigeria.
      You might be wondering what states made the middle-belt.
      The states are Benue, Kaduna, Kogi, Kwara, Niger,
      Nasarawa and Abuja the capital city. This is very important
      for me because is part of my heritage and so proud to
      be part of this people. I come from the Eastern part
      of the Kogi State from the Igala tribe. We speak Igala
      in my village predominantly but, there are well over
      20 other languages in the state as a whole.
      Growing up was a difficult task as I lost my dad at the age
      of 14 and my mum took charge of the family with 6 children to
      take care of. This left me with no option to find a means of
      survival after I turned 21.

      I found solace in music learning the bass guitar as a consolation
      to the happiness I lost at a young age. I got myself into school
      for my National Diploma in computer science and was playing in a
      church to support my mum with my tuition fees and other needed materials,
      which I survived. I continue to play for church when I got another diploma
      in Music and with that, I got a job in a school to teach music, but my passion
      still remains to get my hands dirty writing code of securing the system of
      networking, I just want to do something related to computer.

      Altschool, has finally presented me with exactly what I needed to
      start my computing journey. Although, the whole thing seems had to
      come by but, is interesting to see how html and css makes everything
      beautiful, thank God for the amazing teacher we have got Mr Oluwasetimi.
      He has done a great work handling the classes with the online classes
      every Wednesdays and Saturdays. Although, I signed in to study Cyber
      Security but, the school dim it fit to know something about web designing,
      sometimes I am tempted to spread my tentacles here LOL! But I have to move
      to my area of interest. I will here if there are any updates will late you
      guys know.
